        <p>EU data protection legislation is some of the best in the world, but the past year has seen a number of upheavals in how things are done.</p>

        <p>Changes to the law are being made in substantive ways, and also in procedural ways for how the law will be implemented in the EU region and affect the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>Particularly in relation to the EU and US data protection relationship, changes from the EU Data Protection Directive to the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will affect not just EU citizens, but other countries around the world, with the US in particular bearing a large number of these changes detrimentally.</p>

        <p>In tandem, the striking down of the EU-US Safe Harbor provision made large changes to how the EU deals with the transfer of data to the US, and the new EU-US Privacy Shield is still to be tested."</p>

        <p>Let's take a look at what the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is, what it will change, and how businesses can comply going forward.</p>
